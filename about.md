Hey, I am Seren. I am currently working as a full stack Software Engineer at Elsevier.
I graduated from Oxford Brookes with a 2:1 in Software Engineering student. My industrial work placement was spent working at Incuna as a frontend web developer.
I am a dyslexic who's passionate about accessibility and also enjoys nail art.
